### History of Microsoft from Bill Gates to Satya Nadella and various programming languages used in developing various windows applications.
#### Introduction
Microsoft has been known by many as just a mare company that gives sources to windows operating systems and personal computer software systems, but many have no idea how widespread Microsoft is in terms of the world of computing and technology. Therefore, in these tutorials, we will cover a wide range of products that Microsoft is offering and the languages Microsoft used to develop the products.
Based in America, Microsoft corporation company is ranked top of the leading developer companies in the world today. Founded in 1975 by Bill Gates and Paul Allen. The two boyhood friends derived the name Microsoft from two words i.e., software and microcomputer, and sliced the first 5 letters combined with the slice of four letters from software to come up with Microsoft.  Since then, the company has gone through various revolutions and achieved several successes through the way until where it is now. In the lifetime of Microsoft, it has been led by only three CEO starting with Bill Gates from 1975 to 2002, from February 2002 until 2014 Steve Ballmer took control of Microsoft after which he handed over the company to Satya Nadella.

#### Prerequisites
To follow along with these tutorial you must:

- Have some basic knowledge on various programming languages.


#### Key Takeaways
At the end of this article the reader will have:
- Understood the importance of various programming languages and its real life application.
- Known some of the products that Microsoft developed using these programming languages.
- Have the interest to know more about Microsoft company as a whole.

    To start with, we will look at background information on various products that Microsoft has developed ever since. in addition, you will have general but important details over various languages that have been of benefit to Microsoft in developing most of its products, among them include; Windows 95, WindowsXP, Yahoo, Bing, MS-DOS, Internet Explorer, Microsoft Azure, various versions of Microsoft Servers among many other products. All of the above products came to existence due to the following languages:
#### C++ and C
    Microsoft has been using C++ to develop its applications and software including operating systems and various devices like personal computers and phones. Microsoft opts for C++ because of its rich nature of a broad category of window-specific libraries. Additionally, Microsoft uses Visual studio and the MFC/ATL wrapper libraries to develop various windows programs. Most windows API applications are written in C. These APIs that is, Component Object Model (COM) is used to access the operating system. To develop native desktop applications, the company uses WIN32 APIs and c-style messages to loop various operating system events.
    Microsoft uses C++ for windows application because it is precise, has less power consumption, less GPU usage in general computing, quick access to DirectX, and its rich libraries.
#### JAVA
    A high-level object-oriented and class-based programming language with very few implementation dependencies, Java has been of choice to a Microsoft company. They use the language to build desktop applications, web applications, games, application servers, and web servers. Microsoft finds it of more benefit in developing its products.
#### JAVASCRIPT & PHP
    Microsoft uses JavaScript for most of its front-end projects, and software engineering jobs that require some experience in this language. In most of its front-end projects, Microsoft finds Javascript beneficial in a wider range of applications. They use JavaScript to create websites and applications, also it uses it in adding interactive functionalities to the websites and in game development. On the other hand they use PHP for backend website development.

#### PYTHON
    As a well-known company, Microsoft uses python in various fields of application. Python is a well-established language and a highly popular language. They uses python in Data science, developing machine learning models, web applications, and gaming apps. The basic reason for this choice is that python has vast assortments of libraries and packages.
#### C#
    Pronounced as 'C sharp' the language is general-purpose object-oriented language developed by Microsoft itself by the lead of Anders Hejlsberg and his team. with the help of the .Net initiative, the .Net framework applications are designed in such a manner that various languages can be able to use it. Microsoft considers combining the efficiency and power of C# and .NET to create a user interface. C# is used to, develop games, develop desktop applications and web applications. The language is easy to use and has a large community which makes it better to develop new tools and software.

Among the products that Microsoft developed by the above languages include:
#### BING
    BING is a search engine that was first established in 2009 by Microsoft. After this release, Microsoft had maximum hope that they would change the dynamics of the search engine market after Google had taken lead over the years since 1995. Bing was designed to display and get more information in search pages to enable more retrieving of information in search pages. 
    Microsoft developed Bing using ASB.NET, these is a cross-platform, and an open-source Microsoft framework. The applications built in this platform have combined codes where the codes can use the whole hierarchy of classes in the .NET Framework. 
#### MICROSOFT EDGE
    Microsoft edge is a search engine developed by Microsoft and is supported by windows 10, windows 11Xbox one Xbox series X, and Series S console. It was first released in 2015.
    Edge initially was the proprietary layout engine of Edge HTML. JavaScript is now the version that is known as Microsoft edge legacy. Edge was written in C++ programming language.
#### MS DOS
    MS-DOS or Microsoft Disc Operating System was among the first Microsoft Operating System. As the name suggests, MS-DOS is derived from its ability to work with discs. This means that the operating system supplies several ways of listing, writing files on media, and listing. The languages used to develop the MS-DOS platform are Assembly language, C, and BASIC.
#### MICROSOFT SOLITAIRE
    Developed in 1988, the game has been included as part of the Windows product line since 1990. The card checks deck game originally known as windows Solitaire was developed to teach users how to use the mouse but it has been the most dominating game being played daily in the past 30 years.

#### Conclusion.
Programming languages are the back born of today's technology, therefore we as today's tech generation must invest much in these programming languages. Therefore, we should develop much interest to learn these languages purposely to be of help in the upcoming generations.
Hope this article helped.
Happy Learning!!
