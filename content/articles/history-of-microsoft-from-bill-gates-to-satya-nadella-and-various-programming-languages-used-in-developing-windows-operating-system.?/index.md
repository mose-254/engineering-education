###History of Microsoft from Bill Gates to Satya Nadella and various programming languages used in developing various windows applications.

#### Introduction
Microsoft corporation is an American company. Itâ€™s ranked as the leading developer companies in the world today. Founded in 1975 by Bill Gates and Paul Allen. The two boyhood friends derived the name Microsoft from the words software and microcomputer. They sliced the first 5 letters combined with the slice of the four letters from software to come up with the name Microsoft. Since then, the company has gone through various revolutions. It has achieved several successes along the way until where it is now. Since its establishment, Microsoft has passed through the leadership of Bill Gates from 1975 to 2002. Steve Ballmer took over from Gates and he led the company from February 2002 until 2014. He then handed over the leadership to Satya Nadella.

The company is a source of various windows operating systems, and many other desktop software. Besides, they yield devices such as mobile phones, laptops and desktop gadgets. So, in this tutorial, we will cover a wide range of products offered by Microsoft. Also, we will cover the languages that the company use to develop such products.

#### Prerequisites
To follow along with this tutorial you must:
- Have some basic skills on various programming languages.


#### Key Takeaways
At the end of this article the reader will have:
- Understood the significance of various programming languages and its real-life application.
- Known some of the products that Microsoft developed through various programming languages.


For the start, we will look at background information on various products that Microsoft has developed ever since. Besides, we will have detailed study over various languages that has been of benefit to Microsoft. Some of the products are; Windows 95, WindowsXP, Yahoo, Bing, MS-DOS, Internet Explorer, Microsoft Azure, various versions of Microsoft Servers among many other products. All the above products came to existence as a result of the following programming languages:

#### C++ and C
Microsoft has been using and still is using C++ to develop its applications and software like windows operating systems and various devices like personal computers and mobile phones. Microsoft uses C++ because it has a broad category of window-specific libraries. Additionally, the company uses Visual studio and the MFC/ATL wrapper libraries to develop various windows programs. Most windows API applications are written in C. Component Object Model (COM) API is used to access the operating system and to develop native desktop applications. The company uses WIN32 APIs and c-style messages to loop various operating system events. C++ is precise hence MS found it suitable to use also, the language has less power consumption, less GPU usage in general computing and quick access to DirectX.



#### JAVA
It is a high-level object-oriented and class-based programming language. It has few implementation dependencies, and it has been a better choice to a Microsoft company. They use the language to develop desktop applications, web applications, games, application servers, and web servers.


#### JAVASCRIPT & PHP
Microsoft uses JavaScript for most of its front-end projects, and software engineering jobs that need some experience in JavaScript. Additionally, they find it beneficial in a wider range of applications. They use JavaScript to create websites and applications. Also, they use JavaScript in adding interactive functionalities to the websites and in game development. Besides, they use PHP for backend website development.

#### PYTHON
Microsoft uses python in various fields of application. Python is a well-established language and a popular language. They use python in Data science, developing machine learning models, web applications, and gaming apps. The basic reason for choosing python is that it has vast assortments of libraries and packages.



#### C
Pronounced as 'C sharp' the language is general-purpose object-oriented developed by Microsoft itself through Anders Hejlsberg and his team. with the help of the .Net initiative, the .Net framework applications are designed in such a manner that various languages can be able to use it. Microsoft considers combining the efficiency and power of C# and .NET to create a user interface. C# is used to, develop games, desktop applications and web applications. The language is easy to use and has a large community which makes it better to develop new tools and software.
Among the products that Microsoft developed by the described languages include:


#### BING
Is a search engine that was first established in 2009 by Microsoft. After its release, Microsoft hoped that they would change the dynamics of the search engine market after Google had taken lead over two decades since 1995. Bing was designed to display and get more information in search pages to enable more retrieval of information in search pages. 
Microsoft developed Bing using ASB.NET, which is a cross-platform, and an open-source Microsoft framework. The applications built in this platform have combined codes where they can use the whole hierarchy of classes in the .NET Framework. 


#### MICROSOFT EDGE
This is a search engine developed by Microsoft and is supported by windows 10, windows 11Xbox one Xbox series X, and Series S console. Its first release was in 2015.
Edge was the proprietary layout engine of Edge HTML. Today JavaScript is the version that is known as Microsoft edge legacy. Edge was written in C++ programming language.

#### MS DOS
Microsoft Disc Operating System was among the first Microsoft Operating System ever developed. As the name suggests, MS-DOS is derived from its ability to work with discs. This means the operating system supplies several ways of listing, writing files on media, and listing. The languages used to develop the MS-DOS platform are Assembly language, C, and BASIC.

#### MICROSOFT SOLITAIRE
Developed in 1988, the game engine has been included as part of the Windows product line since 1990. The cards checker deck game known as windows Solitaire was developed to teach users ways in which they can use the mouse but, it has been the most dominating game being played daily in the past 30 years.

#### Conclusion.
Programming languages are the back born of today's technology. Thus we as today's tech generation must invest much in this field. Thus, we should develop much interest to learn these languages to be of help to the upcoming generations.

Hope this article helped.

Happy Learning!!
